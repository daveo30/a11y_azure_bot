# Enhancing access to information on assistive technologies for people with disabilities in low and middle income countries


## Project Background
In low and middle income countries, issues related to inequitable access to assistive technologies for people with disabilities including supply chain challenges, lack of an ecosystem for innovators and entrepreneurs, lack of funding and support etc. exist. But, a key challenge is distribution and lack of awareness. Technology has the ability to play a role in creating this awareness amongst various stakeholders including people with disabilities, innovators among others.
 
The purpose of the project is to create a solution that serves users with disabilities in low and middle income countries, with a special focus on India. This solution would help the users discover the most meaningful information on access to assistive technologies and support them through the process of acquiring them.
